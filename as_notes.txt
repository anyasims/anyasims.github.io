########## STUFF I HAVE CHANGED:
 - Colours in _sass/_themes.scss (see README for how to change colours).

 - Have commented out loads of stuff in `_includes/header.html` to remove all the other links from the nav-bar
 - Have commented out `permalink: ....` from all the pages, eg. /people/, /publications/ etc...
            (so that doesn't take you to the default einsten version of the page if cheekily type extension into the url)
 - This^ still doesnt stop you from typing in /blog/ to url and getting to default einstein blog, so:
        - Have commented out everything in `blog/index.html` and renamed "/_posts/" to "/_posts_renamed/"
        - Change this back to re-enable blog (+ uncomment stuff in header file so can get there with buttons)



########## STUFF TO KNOW:
- Stuff in `_site/....` is automatically generated from the other files,
    so changing anything here is overwritten almost immediately and doesn't change anything
- How to tell if a file is something you can edit, or if it is generated automatically from another file:
                If it has nice indenting then you can edit it,
                If it has no indenting then this is generated automatically.

                But yeah basically anything in _site/.... is generated automatically,
                and anything else you can edit (basically see .gitignore)
