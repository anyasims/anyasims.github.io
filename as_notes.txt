########## TO RUN:
        Open docker desktop app.
            Click the play button on the container called "anyasimsgithubio".
        Then open terminal.
            Run:
            ```
                cd /Users/anyasims/Documents/Oxford/website/anyasims.github.io
                docker compose pull
                docker compose up
            ```
        Then go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/

 
 
########## STUFF I HAVE CHANGED:
 - Colours in _sass/_themes.scss (see README for how to change colours).

 - Have commented out loads of stuff in `_includes/header.html` to remove all the other links from the nav-bar
 - Have commented out `permalink: ....` from all the pages, eg. /people/, /publications/ etc...
            (so that doesn't take you to the default einsten version of the page if cheekily type extension into the url)
 - This^ still doesnt stop you from typing in /blog/ to url and getting to default einstein blog, so:
        - Have commented out everything in `blog/index.html` and renamed "/_posts/" to "/_posts_renamed/"
        - Change this back to re-enable blog (+ uncomment stuff in header file so can get there with buttons)



########## STUFF TO KNOW:
- Stuff in `_site/....` is automatically generated from the other files,
    so changing anything here is overwritten almost immediately and doesn't change anything
- How to tell if a file is something you can edit, or if it is generated automatically from another file:
                If it has nice indenting then you can edit it,
                If it has no indenting then this is generated automatically.

                But yeah basically anything in _site/.... is generated automatically,
                and anything else you can edit (basically see .gitignore)


########## TO PUSH TO github:
        ```
        cd Documents/Oxford/website/anyasims.github.io
        git status
        git add .
        git commit -m "message"
        git push origin master
        ```


########## Fixing after `docker compose up` stopped working in making it show up at http://0.0.0.0:8080/

The error said something like "could not find gem XXX" issue.
As far as I understand this is because it is using the most up-to-date docker image
    but still the version of the code from when I initially cloned the repo.

The solution was update the code with:
    ```
    # Assuming the current directory is <your-repo-name>
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.git
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git rebase v0.11.0
    ```
    --> And then loads of "accept current change" to accept all the changes.

    (as shown in the FAQ here:
    https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/FAQ.md#i-am-trying-to-deploy-my-site-but-it-fails-with-could-not-find-gem-jekyll-diagrams-in-locally-installed-gems-how-do-i-fix-that
    which directs you to the readme upgrading section:
