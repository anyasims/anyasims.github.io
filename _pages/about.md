Hi! I’m a second year PhD student at Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/) and [OXCSML](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group.

I am currently working on deep reinforcement learning - trying to improve understanding of when and why training fails, and how we can make current algorithms more robust. I'm particularly exited about using meta-learning to discover reinforcement learning algorithms. More broadly I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning and understanding optimization dynamics in training deep models so that we can make sense of what models are learning and why.

Before coming to Oxford, I completed a BEng and Masters in Computer and Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where I did my Masters project on language models for automatic speech recognition, supervised by [Prof. Phil Woodland](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pw117). I also worked with [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/) in the [Cambridge Machine Learning Group (MLG)](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/) on causal representation learning.
